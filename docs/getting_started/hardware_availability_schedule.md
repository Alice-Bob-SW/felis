# Hardware availability schedule

All emulators in the remote provider are expected to be available 24/7.

Real chips, when they first launch, will only be available during predetermined time slots.

Likely several hours a day, several days a week, but probably not at night (Paris time) or during weekends.

This will let us monitor how the chips behave and react in real time to any issues that might arise.

If things go smoothly, our goal is to move towards 24/7 availability as soon as possible.

We expect there will always be scheduled down times for maintenance though, but we will work to keep them as short as possible.

We will update this page with a more detailed schedule when the first chip launches.
