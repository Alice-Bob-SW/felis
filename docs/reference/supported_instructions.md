# Supported instructions

## Supported Qiskit gates

### Logical backends

Logical backends ([`EMU:15Q:LOGICAL_EARLY`](../backends/backends_list/logical_early.md) and [`EMU:40Q:LOGICAL_TARGET`](../backends/backends_list/logical_target.md)) support a universal set of gates, so they should run any gate listed in [https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/3_summary_of_quantum_operations.html](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/3_summary_of_quantum_operations.html).

If the gate is not part of the backend's native gate set, it will be implemented through transpilation, as shown in [this example](../getting_started/logical_example.md).

### Physical backends

Physical backends support a limited set of gates among the following:

- `delay(duration, qarg=qubit_index, unit='ns')`
    - This is a [native Qiskit gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.Delay)
    - It attempts to preserve the state of qubit `qubit_index` during the specified `duration` and `unit`
    - Minimum value: 1 ns
- `initialize(value, qubit_index)`
    - This is a custom Felis gate
    - It initializes qubit `qubit_index` to one of four supported `value`:   `'0'`, `'1'`, `'+'`, `'-'`
- `z(qubit_index)`
    - This is a [native Qiskit gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.ZGate)
    - It performs a phase-flip (transforming $\ket{+}$ into $\ket{-}$ and the reverse) on qubit `qubit_index`
- `x(qubit_index)`
    - This is a [native Qiskit gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.XGate)
    - It performs a bit-flip (transforming $\ket{0}$ into $\ket{1}$ and the reverse) on qubit `qubit_index`
- `rz(angle, qubit_index)`
	- This is a [native Qiskit gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RZGate)
	- It performs a rotation of angle `angle` around the Z axis on qubit `qubit_index`
- `cx(qubit_index_1, qubit_index_2)`
	- This is a [native Qiskit gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate)
	- It performs a controlled X gate (also called "CNOT") between qubits `qubit_index_1` and `qubit_index_2`
	- It is only available on backends featuring at least 2 qubits
- `measure(qubit_index, clbit_index)`
    - This is a [native Qiskit gate](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.Measure)
    - It performs a Z measurement on qubit `qubit_index` and stores the result in the classical bit `clbit_index`
- `measure_x(qubit_index, clbit_index)`
    - This is a custom Felis gate
    - It performs an X measurement on qubit `qubit_index` and stores the result in the classical bit `clbit_index`
    - The native Qiskit equivalent would be `H` + `measure`, but `H` is not supported by physical backends.

Note that these operations are all bias-preserving (i.e. they do not convert a phase-flip error into a bit-flip error).

Any instruction other than those listed above is not supported by physical backends.

To know which gate is supported by which backend, check your backend's page in the [Backends section](../backends/about_backends.md)

Gates must be added to a Qiskit `QuantumCircuit`. For example:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

circ = QuantumCircuit(1,1)
circ.x(0)
```

## Supported QIR instructions

The API exposes the list of available targets (the equivalent of Qiskit backends) and details for each of them the list of supported instructions.

When working with the remote provider `AliceBobRemoteProvider`, the supported QIR instructions are fetched by the provider from the API and converted into Qiskit instructions.
