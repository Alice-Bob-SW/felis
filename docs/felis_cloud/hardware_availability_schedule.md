ðŸ’¡ **Note:** We are still in the early stages of operating our chips on the cloud.

We might need to take down the chip at any moment without advance notice. Should this happen, we will update this page and give more information in our [Slack community, The Cat Tree](https://join.slack.com/t/the-cat-tree/shared_invite/zt-2cg0a3rno-PP~AaUztS3dtiRyzsawlnQ).

If you would like to run experiments outside of the public availability schedule, we are happy to explore custom solutions, please [contact us](../contact_us.md).
