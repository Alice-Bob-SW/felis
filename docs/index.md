# Felis documentation - Alice & Bob

Welcome to Felis, Alice & Bobâ€™s toolkit to let you experiment with cat qubits! ðŸ˜º

With Felis, you can run quantum programs on a real quantum computer based on cat qubits, or on cat qubit emulators running in the cloud or on our own machine.

## Getting started

[Install the Qiskit provider](getting_started/install_the_qiskit_provider.md)

[A first example](getting_started/a_first_example.md)

[Working with cat qubits: similarities & differences](getting_started/working_with_cat_qubits.md)

[Hardware availability schedule](getting_started/hardware_availability_schedule.md)

## Going further

[Supported instructions](going_further/supported_instructions.md)

[Backends](going_further/backends.md)

[Sample notebook library](going_further/sample_notebooks.md)

[About error models in emulators](going_further/about_error_models.md)

[How to run multiple circuits remotely](going_further/run_multiple_circuits.md)

## About this release

Felis is still in a beta phase, but it already lets you execute quantum circuits on several cat qubit emulators running on a classical computer.

You can do this through:

- A [Qiskit provider](getting_started/install_the_qiskit_provider.md), taking Qiskit circuits as an input
- An [API](about_api_providers/the_api.md), taking QIR code as an input

Felis will soon feature real (and record-breaking ;)) hardware, but the experience with the emulators is virtually identical.

This beta version is an opportunity for you to help us shape the future of Alice & Bob tools.

So, if: 

- Thereâ€™s anything you would like to do but canâ€™t do
- Thereâ€™s anything that doesnâ€™t work as you expected

â€¦ please [reach out](contact_us.md), weâ€™ll be happy to know!
