# About error models in emulators

Our emulators try to replicate as accurately as possible the behavior of past and current Alice & Bob chips. They also try to forecast what the behavior of future Alice & Bob chips might look like.

Since these emulators are open sourced, you are free to explore the mathematical models we used, but we also want to explain how we came up with these models.

This page, which we will update shortly, will give a detailed explanation for each of our backends.
